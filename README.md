# Shoutbox

Shoutbox was our first crack at creating a real time chat application that anyone could use.  It's an offshoot of our previous One List project which allowed anyone to edit the app for everyone.  One thing I enjoyed about this project was the process of simplifying it and finding out which parts are truly necessary.
